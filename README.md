                                                          🏠 House Price Prediction
📄 Overview:-
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other attributes using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices, which can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts in making informed decisions.

🎯 Objectives:-
1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between features and house prices.
2.Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).
3.Build and evaluate regression models for price prediction.
4.Visualize data insights and model performance using data visualization techniques.

🧹 Data Preprocessing:-
Missing Values: Imputed using mean/median or mode.
Categorical Variables: Encoded using One-Hot Encoding.
Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler.

⚙️ Technologies Used:-
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy — Data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib, seaborn — Data visualization
jupyter notebook — Development environment

🤖 Model Building:-
Models implemented and compared:
1.Linear Regression
2.Random Forest Regressor

🧠 Key Learnings:-
1.Importance of feature engineering and data preprocessing in ML performance.
2.How ensemble models like Random Forest outperform basic regression models.
3.Visualization helps uncover insights that improve model accuracy.
